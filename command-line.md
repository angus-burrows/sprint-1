Without using jargon, command line is a tool used to talk in the same language as a computer to do tasks and actions to build digital files.

ls = lists all files in the folder you are in
cd = moves you to the place you wish to go to
pwd = tells you where you and how you got there
mkdir = creates a new home for files to live
cp -r = copies a folder and it's contents to a new place
rm = deletes a file of your choice
echo = repeats your input back into the same place you are in
touch = creates a new file with the name and type you choose
mv = moves a file to a new place
cat = views the contents of a file where you are
